## set -eux explaination
## set -e: This causes the shell to exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status. It's a safety feature to ensure that errors stop the build process.
## set -u: This treats unset variables as an error when substituting.
## set -x: This option makes the shell print each command before executing it, which is useful for debugging.

# groupadd -r postgres --gid=999:
# groupadd: Adds a new group to the system.
# -r: This option specifies that the group being added is a system group, which typically means it's not intended for logging in.
# postgres: The name of the group.
# --gid=999: Specifies the numerical group ID for the group. This is often set to a specific number to avoid conflicts and ensure consistency across different systems and containers.

# useradd -r -g postgres --uid=999 --home-dir=/var/lib/postgresql --shell=/bin/bash postgres:

# useradd: Adds a new user to the system.
# -r: Indicates that this is a system user, similar to the -r option for groupadd.
# -g postgres: Sets the primary group of the new user to postgres.
# --uid=999: Sets the user ID of the new user to 999, matching the group ID.
# --home-dir=/var/lib/postgresql: Specifies the home directory for the user.
# --shell=/bin/bash: Sets the login shell for the user; here, itâ€™s set to Bash.
# postgres: The name of the user to be added.
